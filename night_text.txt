All I can think about right now is what we’d be doing if you were here — and spoiler alert: It’s not snuggling...Goodnight Babe!<|endoftext|>
Goodnight handsome, hope you have amazing dreams tonight… I know I will, since I’m going to sleep thinking about ALL of you…<|endoftext|>
I wish you were here now. Except I have to get some sleep and if you were… well, let’s just say I wouldn’t. G’night!<|endoftext|>
It’s too bad you’re not here right now …hmmmm… on second thought…I should probably stop thinking about it or else I’ll never fall asleep!!<|endoftext|>
Hey Babe, I’m going to get into bed now. Do me a favor and dream about all the things we’re going to do next time we’re in it together. Night-nite!<|endoftext|>
Words can’t express how much I wish you were here in bed with me.<|endoftext|>
My bed is waaaay too big for just me, wish you were here to keep me warm.<|endoftext|>
I bet you look so hot cuddled in your blankets. But not as hot as you’d look cuddled next to me.<|endoftext|>
Just wanted to let you know that you’re my favorite dirty thought … night night!<|endoftext|>
I’m off to bed, but not quite ready to go to sleep. Might stay awake a bit longer thinking about all the things we’d be doing if you were here...<|endoftext|>
Sending you a spicy goodnight text to remind you just how much I’m going to blow your… world tomorrow... Goodnight and sleep well!<|endoftext|>
Brace yourself because my goodnight texts are about to get realllly interesting...<|endoftext|>
Hey handsome I want to hear your goodnight fantasy….and if you’re lucky, maybe I’ll make it come true tomorrow night!<|endoftext|>
This bed feels awfully cold and lonely without you in it… Wish you were here to help me raise the temperature.<|endoftext|>
My favorite bedtime story involves you, me, and no clothes haha.<|endoftext|>
I am going to dream about you all night. I hope they are naughty but nice! Good night.<|endoftext|>
Tonight instead of counting sheep, I’m counting all the places on my body that I want you to kiss... Goodnight!<|endoftext|>
Just so you know, we would be having so. Much. Fun. If only you were here with me right now…<|endoftext|>
Sleep well and I hope that I’ll be the first thing on your mind when you wake up.<|endoftext|>
I just wanted to say sweet dreams. I’ll be thinking of you my love.<|endoftext|>
You look adorable when you sleep. I wish I was there to see it...<|endoftext|>
Can’t sleep for some reason. I have all this energy & no one to do with it. I mean ... nothing to do with it.<|endoftext|>
I could stay up all night thinking of you, but here’s hoping I find you in my dreams. Goodnight love.<|endoftext|>
You know, It’s probably a good thing you’re not sleeping over, because if you were we probably wouldn’t be sleeping!<|endoftext|>
I keep reminding myself that I’m going to dream about you all night, so that I don’t miss you too much right now. G’night!<|endoftext|>
The two things I love most are you and sleep. I hate having to choose! Sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
I was just going through some of our old texts. I am literally smiling ear to ear at my phone right now. Good night!<|endoftext|>
Just so you know, I’ve been laying in bed, replaying the perfect date we had over and over in my head...sleep well and have a good night sweetheart...<|endoftext|>
Forget this bed, pillow and blanket. All I need to fall asleep is your arms wrapped around me...<|endoftext|>
Really wishing that this pillow was your chest to rest my head-on. Goodnight and sweet dreams!<|endoftext|>
I keep staring and smiling at the selfies we take, I have to say we are soooo cute together.Good night Babe!<|endoftext|>
Wishing a good night, to the guy who makes my days bright. Sleep well!<|endoftext|>
Sweet dreams, sleep tight I love you goodnight...<|endoftext|>
I love my bed, but I love you more...<|endoftext|>
I love my cozy bed, but I love you more.<|endoftext|>
I can’t sleep...I wish you were here to tire me out. Goodnight and sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
You are definitely worth losing sleep for... goodnight...<|endoftext|>
I Wish I could fall asleep as fast as I’m falling for you. Sleep well my dear.<|endoftext|>
Even in my dreams I can’t stay away from you...have some sweet dreams!<|endoftext|>
No matter how far away you are, you’ll always be on my mind. Sweet dreams!<|endoftext|>
My favorite step in my nighttime routine is texting you. Miss you love, Goodnight!<|endoftext|>
It feels like forever since I had you next to me... I miss watching you sleep... LOL, only kidding. Maybe...<|endoftext|>
Every night I’m one step closer to getting to the weekend when we can finally be together... Sweet Dreams, Babe!<|endoftext|>
The further away you are, the harder it is for me to fall asleep. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
I wish we were snuggling right now. But I know that we’ll make up for lost cuddle time the next we are together. Good night, love!<|endoftext|>
You’re so funny! I could seriously stay up all night chatting with you. But I can’t, so I guess we’ll have to finish our conversation tomorrow. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
Did I ever tell you that I sleep naked? Too bad you’re not here! Sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
Wrapping my body around this pillow really just isn’t doing it for me. It’s missing the best part.<|endoftext|>
I’m feeling really adventurous tonight. Wish you were here! Goodnight my sweetheart.<|endoftext|>
If we were together right now, I’d love to show you exactly how much I appreciate you before we fell asleep.<|endoftext|>
Too bad you’re not here right now... Oh, wait, wow, I’d better stop thinking about this or I’ll NEVER get to sleep...<|endoftext|>
Ugh! Falling asleep would be a lot more fun if you were here and we were...naked...haha<|endoftext|>
If you have trouble sleeping tonight, that’s probably because you are awake in my dreams. All kidding aside, sleep tight babe, I’ll see you very soon.<|endoftext|>
I can never sleep without you next to me. Counting down the seconds until you’re back here with me!<|endoftext|>
Brrr…soooo cold! I wish you could be here to warm me up.<|endoftext|>
I wish you nothing but the sweetest dreams tonight, and don’t forget I’m always there in spirit. I love you and miss you.<|endoftext|>
Today was super busy but there was no way I was going to go to sleep without telling my favorite person how much they mean to me and how much I wish they were here… (That person is you, BTW.) Goodnight, Babe.<|endoftext|>
I’ll be thinking of you as I drift off to sleep to night, sleep well my love..<|endoftext|>
Babe, I have to tell you that I liked it when you smiled. But I LOVED it that I was the reason. Good night my love!<|endoftext|>
Missing you tonight, I would sleep so much better if you were here with me. Soon my love and for now, G’nite!<|endoftext|>
Good night Babe, My dreams are always more fun when you are in them. Remind me tomorrow to tell you what we get up too...<|endoftext|>
Do you know how hot you are? Hot enough to make falling asleep tonight realllyyy hard. G’night.<|endoftext|>
Goodnight to the most interesting man I know. Sleep well Babe.<|endoftext|>
Hey babe, you killed it today, so go get some well-deserved rest. You can finish taking over the world tomorrow. Sweet dreams!<|endoftext|>
Good night sweetheart, time to get your beauty sleep, not that you need it of course!<|endoftext|>
Hey sweetheart, I hope you dream about me tonight because you’re my dream come true. Good night!<|endoftext|>
Hey, I wanted to let you know I’m really glad you’re doing you tonight. Still, I can’t wait until I have you back in my bed again. Sleep tight babe.<|endoftext|>
Hey, babe, I’m about to hop into bed. Just wanted to say how much you mean to me one more time before I go to sleep. Goodnight!<|endoftext|>
Wish I was snuggling with you right now so bad! Guess I’ll have to dream about it instead. Goodnight, babe!<|endoftext|>
I want your face to be the last thing I see at night and the first thing I see in the morning.<|endoftext|>
You know what the best part of dreaming about you is? Getting to wake up to the reality of you. Sweet dreams sweetheart.<|endoftext|>
I’m in serious need of a cuddle and I can’t wait to be in your arms again! Sweet dreams and goodnight my love.<|endoftext|>
Spending today with you was absolutely perfect. Goodnight my love!<|endoftext|>
I just wanted to send you a quick text to wish you goodnight. I know I just saw you, but I miss you already. Can’t help it! Goodnight, my love.<|endoftext|>
Goodnight my love, I can’t remember a life before you, and you know what? I wouldn’t want too..<|endoftext|>
You light up my life like nobody ever has..sweet dreams...<|endoftext|>
Goodnight my love, sending you hugs, kisses, smiles, and sweet dreams...of me...of course...<|endoftext|>
I was just listening to our song, and wishing you could be here with me. It’s not the same without you. See you soon, my love, and sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
Who needs sleep?… I’m already living out my dreams...with my dream man…have a good night my love, XOXO...<|endoftext|>
What will we be doing together in my dreams tonight...hmmm...I wonder? Anyways get a goodnight and sleep well.<|endoftext|>
I just noticed that my bed is a lot more comfortable with you in it...<|endoftext|>
Instead of counting sheep, I’m counting all the places I want to kiss you... Goodnight!<|endoftext|>
You really brightened my day today. I wish you could make my night as fun as my day was.<|endoftext|>
All snuggled up in bed with my cat. There’s still plenty of room for you though. G’Nite babe!<|endoftext|>
Have you ever had a spicy dream about me? Maybe tonight’s the night...Sleep tight...<|endoftext|>
Hey Babe, I’m just thinking about how cute you look in your pajamas. G’nite!<|endoftext|>
Go to bed and dream about all the naughty things you’re going to do to me when we see each other next.<|endoftext|>
I’m in my bed… you’re in your bed… do you see the problem? G’night!<|endoftext|>
Imagining what would be happening if you were here right now. Spoiler alert: neither of us would be sleeping. Goodnight!<|endoftext|>
I’m hoping that if I text you right before I fall asleep, you’ll appear in my dreams...<|endoftext|>
Confession time...I’ve had a crush on you for as long as I can remember. But knowing that you feel the same makes me sleep a whole lot better...good night! <|endoftext|>
Goodnight, babe. I’m sending you a goodnight kiss and cuddles right now...<|endoftext|>
BTW, I’ve going to bed in almost nothing at all tonight...Wish you were here to see it. G’night!<|endoftext|>
I fell for you because of a million little things you never knew you were doing. Good night my love! <|endoftext|>
G’nite Babe, I couldn’t fall asleep unless I told you how much I miss you and love you goodnight!<|endoftext|>
Tonight was wonderful. You are wonderful. Sleep well...<|endoftext|>
Here’s a little good night note to tuck you in as you fall asleep. Sending soft kisses your way. Sweet dreams.<|endoftext|>
I can’t fall asleep without a comfy pillow and a of course a goodnight text from you.<|endoftext|>
I was just about to fall asleep, and then I remembered how beautiful you are! Now I can’t fall sleep AT all! See what you do to me? Haha, anyways sleep well!<|endoftext|>
There’s nobody I’d rather go to sleep next to, goodnight honey, I love you!<|endoftext|>
Goodnight. Sleep awaits those of us who dare to dream.<|endoftext|>
Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made.<|endoftext|>
Only night can make us whole again. Goodnight my love.<|endoftext|>
By night, beloved, tie your heart to mine and let them both in dreams defeat the darkness. Sweet dreams my love.<|endoftext|>
You can’t change everything in one night, but one night can change everything, like the night we met. I love you, goodnight.<|endoftext|>
I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.<|endoftext|>
I miss you in waves, and tonight I am drowning. I miss you so much, goodnight.<|endoftext|>
You know that place between sleep and awake, the place where you can still remember dreaming? That’s where I will always love you.<|endoftext|>
Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive.<|endoftext|>
There is something to be said for the night. The darkness holds a sense of promise, as if anything could happen.<|endoftext|>
I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
You are the first thing that comes to mind when I wake up and the last thing when I sleep. Thank you for always making me happy. I hope to hear your angelic voice tomorrow. Goodnight, my love.<|endoftext|>
Knowing I will spend the rest of my night dreaming with you is enough to get me sleepy. I never want to lose what we have. Sleep well, dear one.<|endoftext|>
Sweetest, have a blissful night ahead. I hope you will wake up feeling as majestic and beautiful as ever. Never let anything put you down.<|endoftext|>
Goodnight, my dear. I think about you all the time, and I know you have what it takes to face your fears. May this night be peaceful and restful. Get enough sleep because you need the energy to glow tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
Every day has been special since I met you. Your bright smile has taken the night away and has given me hope. Because of you, I believe that true love exists. I am forever grateful to you. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>
I am proud to know that I have you for life because you are my support system. As you sleep, think of us, and all the good times we will have. Goodnight, sweetheart.<|endoftext|>
At night, the moon gets light from the sun, and the sun gets light from you because you glow too much. Thank you for being my ever-present helper and for standing by my side. Have a good night’s rest.<|endoftext|>
Thinking of you makes me jealous of your pillows and sheets because they get to touch and feel your warmth. I wish I could run my hands through your hair and smell your baby face. Have a divine night.<|endoftext|>
All the stars combined would still not amount to the brightness you have brought in my life. You are constantly running on my mind, and I hope to spend more days and nights with you soon. Goodnight, beautiful one.<|endoftext|>
Every night before I sleep, I think about how long it took me to find a soulmate, and it makes me fall in love with you even more. You are phenomenal and beautiful, and I hope you keep that in mind forever. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>

Sleeping beside you is an assurance of our love but waking up and still thinking about you is evidence that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, my angel. Good night.<|endoftext|>
May the stars bring you closer to my love, and may the moon show you how much you mean to me. Good night.<|endoftext|>
The darkness at night can never overshadow my love for you and the brightness of the day is not strong enough to reveal how much I love you. Good night.<|endoftext|>
Every night, I dream and fantasize about all the things we could do together. I can’t wait to spend forever with you. Good night.<|endoftext|>
Look up to the sky and see how the stars are dancing and showcasing my deep love for you.<|endoftext|>
I get happy at night and before bedtime because I know I will be spending my hours with you in my dreams. Good night.<|endoftext|>

I have prepared something special for you in the dreamland. As you close your eyes, think about me, and you will meet me on the other side. Goodnight, sleeping beauty.<|endoftext|>
In many ways, you only compare to the sun, moon, and stars. You mean everything to me, and that’s why you are my worst ‘goodbye’. Goodnight. Keep confusing me with your charms.<|endoftext|>
As the darkness covers my body and the moon shines above me, so does your love and memories of us cloud my mind. There is only one thing greater than love, and it’s what I feel for you. Thank you for being mine. Goodnight.<|endoftext|>

If only I could lock you up inside my heart, so you would understand the depth and heights of what I feel for you. You are the best thing that could happen to me. Goodnight to the love of my life.<|endoftext|>
My night feels incomplete without you. You have filled my mind with positivity and sweet thoughts. For that, I love you unconditionally. Good night, my love.<|endoftext|>
I love you with my whole heart and my whole existence. If I were to share my heart’s desires regarding us, we would spend the night discussing them. I want you to know, you mean so much to me. Good night, my treasure.<|endoftext|>
